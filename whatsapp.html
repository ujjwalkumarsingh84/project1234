            In our much busy schedule we usually don't have time to keep up with our emails, so we'll
            be working on a project to set up alerts of recent emails to WhatsApp.</mark></p>

        <p id="lead"><mark id="mark"><b>Project Context - </b>
            Emails have become one of the most used digital communication mediums. But, sad truth,
            that since they are so aggressively used, it's quite difficult to keep up with them. Moreover,
            people keep on subscribing to new newsletters every now and then, which also adds to this
            cause.
            <br>
            So, in order to make our life a little bit easier, we can build a tool which will fetch us the
            various details from our mail box on query. Twilio is an efficient platform which provides us
            with the features needed to accomplish this. It's a message, email, call and notification
            automation tool/platform. We'll be utilizing some of it's features through this project.</mark></p>
